  WordPress requires a style.css file located in the theme's root folder for
  stuff to work. However, we will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using SASS.

  SASS is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features such as variables,
  nested selectors and loops. It's also the easiest way to customize
  Foundation. All SASS files are located in the /css/src folder.
